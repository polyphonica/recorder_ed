Subject: Registration Deadline Passed - {{ session.workshop.title }}

Hi {{ registration.student.first_name|default:registration.student.username }},

Unfortunately, the deadline to confirm your spot in "{{ session.workshop.title }}" has passed.

The spot has now been offered to the next person on the waitlist.

If you're still interested in this workshop, you can:
1. Check if there are other available sessions: {{ workshop_url }}
2. Join the waitlist again if the session becomes full

We hope to see you in a future workshop!

Best regards,
The {{ site_name }} Team
