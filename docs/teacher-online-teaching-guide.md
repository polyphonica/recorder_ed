## Critical: Audio Settings for Music Teaching

### Why Audio Settings Matter
Standard video conferencing platforms are designed for speech, not music. They automatically:
- ❌ Suppress background noise (including musical instruments!)
- ❌ Cancel echoes (removing resonance and harmonics)
- ❌ Compress audio (losing musical detail)

**You MUST disable these features for music teaching.**

---

## Zoom: Enabling "Original Sound"

### Initial Setup (One-Time)
1. Open Zoom desktop app
2. Click your profile picture → **Settings**
3. Go to **Audio** tab
4. Check **"Show in-meeting option to 'Enable Original Sound' from client"**
5. **IMPORTANT:** Also check these settings:
   - ✅ Suppress background noise: **Low** (or Off)
   - ✅ Echo cancellation: **Auto** or **Aggressive** (keep this on to avoid feedback)

### During Each Lesson
1. Start or join the meeting
2. Click the arrow next to **Mute** button (bottom left)
3. Click **"Turn on Original Sound"**
4. You'll see "Original Sound: On" at the top left

**Pro Tip:** Original Sound must be enabled for EACH meeting - it doesn't stay on by default.

### Testing Your Audio
Before your first lesson:
1. Ask a musical friend to join a test meeting
2. Play your instrument
3. Ask them to confirm they can hear the full, natural sound
4. Check that fast passages aren't cutting out

## Google Meet: Disabling Noise Cancellation

### Free Account (Limited Options)
Unfortunately, free Google accounts have limited noise cancellation controls.

**During Meeting:**
1. Join meeting
2. Click the three dots (⋮) → **Settings**
3. Go to **Audio** tab
4. If available, turn **Noise cancellation** to **Off**

**Note:** This option may not be available on free accounts.

### Workspace Account (Full Control)

**Desktop:**
1. Join meeting
2. Click three dots → **Settings**
3. Go to **Audio** tab
4. Set **Noise cancellation** to **Off**

**Mobile:**
1. Join meeting and tap screen
2. Tap three dots → **Settings**
3. Go to **Audio**
4. Toggle **Noise cancellation** off

### Important Note
Audio from screen sharing (like playing a YouTube video) is NOT affected by noise cancellation - students can hear it properly.
