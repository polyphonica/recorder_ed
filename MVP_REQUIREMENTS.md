## 🎯 Next Steps

Based on this analysis, I recommend starting with **Phase 1: Workshop System** because:

1. **Immediate Value**: Workshops provide immediate, tangible value
2. **Simpler Scope**: Event-based system is more focused than full courses
3. **Revenue Potential**: Workshops can generate income quickly
4. **User Feedback**: Faster iteration and user validation
5. **Foundation**: Builds patterns for course system later

### Recommended Starting Point

**Build the Workshop App** with:

- Workshop creation and management
- Student registration system
- Basic instructor dashboard
- Workshop discovery and booking
- Email notifications

This gives you a complete, functional product that can be launched and monetized while building toward the full platform vision.
